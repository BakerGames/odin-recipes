    <H2>Description</H2>

    <p>I feel like a homemade chocolate chip cookie recipe is something that everyone should have in their recipe box. Several years ago I spent quite a bit of time working on creating the perfect chocolate chip cookies and after several attempts I finally landed on the perfect recipe.</p>
    
    <p>So today I wanted to share this classic cookie recipe with you again because it’s one that I make all of the time! Not only are these the best chocolate chip cookies you’ll every try, but they’re also:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Easy to make</li>
        <li>Incredibly soft and chewy</li>
        <li>Full of melted chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Super delicious!</li>
    </ul>

    <H2>Ingridients</H2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All-Purpose Flour: </strong>The flour is what provides the structure and helps them hold their shape. Just be sure to measure your flour correctly. Too much flour can lead to cookies that won’t spread in the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Soda & Salt:</strong>The baking soda helps give the cookies a little lift and the salt enhances the flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsalted Butter:</strong>I prefer to stick with unsalted butter in all of my recipes, since the amount of salt in salted butters can vary quite a bit between different brands. Only have salted butter on hand? Simply reduce the salt in this recipe to 1/2 teaspoon. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Brown Sugar & Granulated Sugar:</strong>The brown sugar adds moisture and creates chewy chocolate chip cookies while the granulated sugar helps them spread.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs & Vanilla Extract:</strong>There are two eggs in these cookies to bind everything together plus a little vanilla extract. I also recommend using room temperature eggs as they will disperse more evenly into the dough. </li>
        <li><strong>Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips:</strong>I find that semi-sweet chocolate chips work best because they’re not too sweet and not too bitter. Feel free to use any kind that you prefer though!</li>
    </ul>

    <H2>Steps</H2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Whisk together your dry ingredients:</strong> Whisking the dry ingredients separately will help ensure that the baking soda and salt are evenly dispersed in your dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Beat the butter and sugars together:</strong> I like to mix the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together for 1 to 2 minutes or until they’re well combined. </li>
        <li><strong>Mix in the eggs and vanilla extract:</strong> It’s best to mix in the eggs one at a time, then mix in the vanilla. I also suggest stopping to scrape down the sides of your bowl at this point and mix one more time before adding the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the dry ingredients:</strong> You only need to mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix in the chocolate chips:</strong> You can either gently fold in the chocolate chips or mix them in on low-speed until they’re fully incorporated into the cookie dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the cookie dough:</strong> This will help ensure that your cookies don’t spread too much in the oven. I find that two hours is the perfect amount of time!</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake the cookie dough:</strong> I suggest using a 1.5 tablespoon cookie scoop because it creates the perfect cookie. The cookies will also take about 10 to 12 minutes in a 350°F (177°C) oven. You’ll know they’re done when the tops are set and the edges are lightly golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Allow the cookies to cool:</strong> I prefer to let them cool on the baking sheets for 5 to 10 minutes, since the residual heat helps the cookies finish setting up. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Quick tip: </strong>If you want perfectly round cookies, use a spoon to shape the warm cookies once they come out of the oven.</p>
